# nuxeo-google-calendar-publisher
This plugin enables you to publish on Google Calendar through a nuxeo automation operation.

## Build

Assuming [maven](http://maven.apache.org/) (3.2.1) is installed on your system, after downloading the whole repository, execute the following:
```
mvn install
```

## Deploy

Upload the package marketplace generated under the folder nuxeo-google-calendar-publisher-mp/target/ into your local packages of the nuxeo platform and install it.

## Nuxeo Studio

Import the automation operation "Publisher" in your project registry. You will find a new entry under the automation tools:

**Notification>Publish on Google Calendar**

This operation expects multiple parameters:
- userEmailAddress: the user e-mail to whom an event will be created
- summary: the title of the event
- location: the location of the event
- description: the description of the event
- startDate: the start date of the event (currently only full days events are handled)
- endDate: the end date of the event
- attendeeEmailAddress: e-mail address of the attendee (currently only one attendee is handled)

## Configuration in the Nuxeo platform

We use the OAuth2 authentification mechanism in order to do the publication on behalf of a user. In order to do that you need to have a google calendar api account with a client ID and Client Secret token. If you don't have one you have to create it here: https://console.developers.google.com/

Then you need to add some modification under Administrator>Cloud Services>Service Providers>googledrive
- Edit the Client ID and the Client Secret. Note that this is actually a workaround, the ideal solution would be to have a dedicated service provider named googlecalendar.

- Edit the scope part by adding "email,https://www.google.com/calendar/feeds/" in order that the user authorizes the offline access to his calendar.
 
## Usage

Before launching the operation of publication, make sure that you go through the offline access authorization process, in order to have a valid token for the api. To do so, you need to go to Home>Cloud Services and Connect to Google Drive then accept the offline access to the user's calendar.
That's it! Now you can run your publication operation, and you should be able to see that an event has been published on the calendar of the user.

## Important Note

**These features are not part of the Nuxeo Production platform.**

These solutions are provided for inspiration and we encourage customers to use them as code samples and learning resources.

This is a moving project (no API maintenance, no deprecation process, etc.) If any of these solutions are found to be useful for the Nuxeo Platform in general, they will be integrated directly into platform, not maintained here.
